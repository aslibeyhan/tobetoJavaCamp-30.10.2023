I have compiled all the assignments given by our instructors within the scope of the Tobeto - Istanbul Kodluyor project into a single repository for your convenience. It was a challenging yet highly instructive process for me, and I have meticulously worked on it.In this project, you will learn the fundamentals and application of Java & React Fullstack. To run the project, simply download the zip file from the download section, extract the files, and open the project in IntelliJ IDE or any other IDE.
